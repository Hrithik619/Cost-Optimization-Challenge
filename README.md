üí° Proposed Solution: Tiered Storage with Azure Functions & Blob Archive

üß† Core Idea
Move billing records older than 3 months from Azure Cosmos DB to Azure Blob Storage (Archive Tier) while maintaining seamless access via existing APIs. Use Azure Functions to intercept read requests for archived data and serve them from Blob Storage.

üèóÔ∏è Architecture Overview

‚öôÔ∏è Implementation Strategy
1. Data Archival Process
Use a scheduled Azure Function (Timer Trigger) to move old records to Blob Storage.

Pseudocode:

def archive_old_records():
    cutoff_date = datetime.utcnow() - timedelta(days=90)
    query = f"SELECT * FROM c WHERE c.timestamp < '{cutoff_date.isoformat()}'"
    old_records = cosmos_db.query_items(query)

    for record in old_records:
        blob_name = f"{record['id']}.json"
        blob_storage.upload(blob_name, json.dumps(record))
        cosmos_db.delete_item(record['id'])

2. Read Interceptor Logic
Modify the read function to check Cosmos DB first, then fallback to Blob Storage.

Pseudocode:
def get_billing_record(record_id):
    try:
        return cosmos_db.read_item(record_id)
    except ItemNotFound:
        blob_name = f"{record_id}.json"
        return blob_storage.download(blob_name)

3. Blob Storage Configuration
Use Archive Tier for cost savings.

Enable Lifecycle Management to auto-transition blobs to Archive after upload.

4. API Compatibility
Wrap Cosmos DB and Blob logic inside Azure Functions.

Keep API contracts unchanged by abstracting storage logic.

Optional Monitoring and Cost Estimation
Monitoring Tools:

Azure Monitor + Log Analytics to track:

Function execution logs

Cosmos DB RU usage

Blob storage read/write activity

Alerts for:

High error rates

Slow access times

Blob storage nearing capacity

Cost-Saving Estimation:

Cosmos DB storage cost: ~$0.25/GB/month

Blob Hot storage cost: ~$0.0184/GB/month

Blob Cold storage: ~$0.01/GB/month

Assuming 2M records x 300KB = ~572 GB

Storage Type	Cost for 572 GB
Cosmos DB	~$143/month
Blob Storage (Hot)	~$10.5/month
Blob Storage (Cold)	~$5.72/month

Savings: Up to 90‚Äì95% on storage for cold data
